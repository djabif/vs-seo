      <p class="effective">(Effective as of August 30, 2016)</p>
    </h1>
    <p>Protecting your private information is our priority. This Privacy Policy applies to the VisaLex, LLC (“VISALEX”) website and client portal (the “Site”) and governs data collection and usage. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to VISALEX include the Site. Please review this policy to understand the steps that VISALEX has taken to secure your personal information.</p>
    <p>By using the VISALEX website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement. This Privacy Policy explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed with respect to your use of the Site, so you can make an informed decision about using the Site. We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to the Policy, we will post a new statement on the Site and update the effective date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check the effective date of the Policy whenever you visit the Site to see if it has been updated since your last visit.</p>

    <h2 id="goto1" class="alt-heading">INFORMATION COLLECTED BY VISALEX</h2>
    <p>VISALEX will not disclose your personal information to any outside party without your consent, except in limited circumstances to our business partners with whom we have established agreements that protect consumer privacy, and to the attorneys and legal staff (“Attorneys”) working on your case. VISALEX has designed its Website to ensure the privacy of your personal information and will use best practices and current security standards regarding encryption and data storage to safeguard your privacy.</p>
    <p>As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, or e-mail address,), and information about that individual's location or activities or demographic information when such information is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
    <p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit the Site. We may collect the personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, when you fill out a form, send us an email, make a request, complete a survey, register for certain services on the Site, or participate in certain activities on the Site, we may ask you to provide personal information such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number.</p>
    <p>We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, and preferences. Information we collect may be combined with information we obtained through other services we offer. The information is stored securely and is kept as you consented.</p>
    <p>Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by the Site. This information can include: your Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, etc.), browser software (e.g., Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Chrome, Safari, etc.), domain names, access times, referring website addresses, the website pages you view, the website links you click and other site usage data. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Site, by gathering broad demographic information to help us serve you through understanding how visitors use our website.</p>
    <p>A technology called “cookies”, small files which are stored by your browser to help keep track of your user profile, are used by our website. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and are not shared with anyone other than the Attorneys (third party counsel retained by VISALEX, as VISALEX is not a law firm).</p>
    <p>Using VISALEX’s services will include providing an extensive amount of personal information for the preparation of petitions and applications. This information is password protected. Extreme care is always taken to ensure that it is only shared with the Attorneys and legal staff responsible for preparing your case, as well as with the government agencies that process the petitions and applications filed for immigrant and nonimmigrant benefits.</p>
    <p>Credit card information shall be transmitted from VISALEX, as needed, through secure serves to our merchant provider. The data is strongly encrypted during its transmission in order to ensure that the payment information and personal information is secure.</p>
    <p>Please be aware that we may provide links to third party websites from the Site as a service to its users and we are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those sites. We have no ability to control the privacy and data collection practices of such sites and the privacy policies of such sites may differ from this Policy. Therefore, VISALEX encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from the Site so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information, before providing them with any information.</p>
    <p>VISALEX will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on VISALEX or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of the Site; and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site, or the public.</p>
    <p>This privacy policy does not extend to any information that is inherent in the operation of the Internet and, therefore, beyond the control of VISALEX. The policy is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. VISALEX may disclose your personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the requirements of the law or comply with governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on VISALEX; and/or (2) protect and defend the property and/or rights of VISALEX, and/or the users of VISALEX products and services.</p>
    <h2 id="goto2" class="alt-heading">HWHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>VISALEX collects personal and contact information for a number of reasons. Personal data collected in questionnaires is used by VISALEX’s staff and by the Attorneys in order to prepare and submit petitions, applications, and other supporting documents to government agencies for the purpose of your immigrant and nonimmigrant benefits. VISALEX may also provide United States immigration news to its registered users, as well as provide updates on VISALEX. All of the accounts of VISALEX are maintained separately from one another. All VISALEX accounts also require secure authentication to access personal information.</p>
    <p>VISALEX will provide to the Attorneys the necessary information so that they may submit required information, petitions, applications, and other documents to the appropriate government agencies on your behalf. The information you have provided via the online questionnaires will be used to complete the documents and forms for your case by the Attorneys. As transactions are made, VISALEX’s processor merchant account will have client credit card information submitted to it.</p>
    <h2 id="goto3" class="alt-heading">Sharing of Your Information</h2>
    <p>VISALEX uses commercially reasonable measures to secure and maintain personally identifying information, to protect it from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction by any unauthorized party while it is under our control.</p>
